INSERT INTO `diseases` VALUES (1,'Onion','Damping-off is primarily caused by fungi present in the growing medium. The fungi include species of Rhizoctonia, Pythium, Fusarium, Phytophthora, Sclerotinia, Sclerotium, Botrytis, and others. Germinating seed and seedlings, especially weak ones, are vulnerable to attack by these fungi during periods of unfavorable growing conditions. Species of Pythium, Sclerotinia, and Phytophthora are more likely to cause damping-off in cool, wet soils; whereas species of Rhizoctonia, Fusarium and Sclerotium rolfsii may cause damping-off under warmer and drier conditions.Typical symptoms of damping-off are rotting stems at or near the soil line and root decay (post-emerging damping off). Affected areas in the seed bed are usually a foot or more in diameter with shriveled brown, collapsed or stunted seedlings. Rhizoctonia, Fusarium, Sclerotinia, and Sclerotium generally caused post emergence damping-off by killing the seedling at the soil line. Pythium attacks below the soil line, often at root tips.\n\nMoldy fungal growth may be seen on affected plants at the soil line. Germinating seed can also be attacked by these fungi before they emerge from the soil (pre-emerging damping off), resulting in poor stands.True damping-off may be confused with plant injury caused by excessive fertilization, high soluble salts, drowning in wet soil, desiccation in dry soil, and death of seedlings from excessive heat, cold, fuel fumes, or chemical injury. This type injury often damages the leaves and upper stem before the roots are affected. Typically, plants affected by damping-off will be scattered or occur in patches whereas plants affected by abiotic issues mentioned above will be more consistently affected and at or near 100% incidence.','Damping off','TRICHODERMA spp.','The best control of damping-off is to avoid it altogether. Once damping-off has started in a plant bed or seedling flat, it may be difficult to control. The general methods employed to prevent damping-off consists of:\n\nSanitize all seed trays and flats and store them in a clean location when not in use.\nProper soil preparation and management to provide for good soil drainage, structure, aeration, water-holding capacity and plant nutrition by including proper amounts of fertilizer and lime according to the soil test report.\nProper soil treatment with heat or chemicals to reduce the level of fungi that cause damping-off.\nThe use of fungicide-treated seed with high germination (see North Carolina Agricultural Chemicals Manual; specify treated seed before purchasing),\nProper seeding rates to avoid thick plant stands, poor air movement and low light intensity.\nProper planting depth and soil temperature to assure rapid seeding emergence and growth.\nStrict sanitation to avoid reinfesting treated soil with these fungi. Many outbreaks of damping-off in North Carolina can be attributed to poor sanitation practices after treating the soil. For bedding plant operations, it may be more practical to buy a sterilized soilless mix and eliminate steps 1 and 2 above.\nOnce damping-off has started in a bed or flat, its spread may be reduced by providing drier conditions for better seedling growth. This can be done by increasing greenhouse temperature, increasing air circulation and ventilation, reducing the frequency of watering, providing better water drainage by ditching inside and outside the plant bed structure or greenhouse, and by increasing the amount of light by removing dirty covers, overhanging branches, removing shading materials, etc. If the above preventive control measures fail, several fungicides are available that may be effective if applied as a drench or heavy spray as soon as the first symptoms of damping-off are observed. Growing conditions should be improved and flats or areas of bed with damping-off should be carefully removed from the growing area. Rapid identification of the causal fungus should be obtained so that proper chemicals can be applied (see county agent for diagnosis). Several applications of the fungicide may be necessary, If the specific fungus causing damping-off is not known, one broad spectrum fungicide (captan or ferbam), two specific fungicides (benomyl plus, etridiazole or metalaxyl) or a prepared combination of fungicides (etridiazole + thiophanate methyl) should be used.'),(2,'Potato','In addition to the potato, the pathogen also damages plants such as chili, tomato, tobacco and egg plant, as well as several species of weeds.\nThe symptoms of bacterial wilt infection can be seen on all parts of infected plants.\nInfected plant begins to wilt, starting from the tips of the leaves or where the stems branch out, and then spreading to all parts of the plant.\nLeaves become yellow at their bases, then the whole plant wilts and dies. When stems are cut a brown colored ring will be visible.\nWhen a tuber is cut in half, black or brown rings will, however, be visible. If left for a while or squeezed, these rings will exude a thick white fluid.\nA further symptom is fluid coming out of tuber eyes. This can be signified by soil sticking to tuber eyes when crops are harvested. Serious infection causes tubers to rot.','Bacterial wilt','Algaecide','Potato crop is infested by a variety of fungal, bacterial and viral diseases.  As regards pests, some pests attacks the foliage while some attacks the tubers.  Many of the diseases in potato are soil/seed borne and so once infected is very difficult to control them.  Similarly viruses affect the seed quality and so has a chain of implications.  Thus proper diagnosis and control of pests and diseases is of utmost importance. Some of the important pests and diseases attacking the potato crop are late blight, early blight, wart, common scab, black scurf, bacterial wilt, soft rot/black leg, viruses, cutworm, white grub, aphids, leaf hoppers, tuber moth, mites, potato cyst nematode, root knot nematode etc. Not all pests and diseases are present every where.  Some of them are more widespread than the other while some are very localized e.g. Wart is one such disease, which is confined to the Darjeeling hills while golden nematode is another such pest, which is confined to the Nilgiri hills.'),(3,'Potato','Disease symptoms:\nLess vigorous plants are usually affected\nSmall, round to irregular spots with a grey center and dark margin on leaves\nSpots usually start on lower leaves and gradually advance upwards\nAt later stage spots coalesce and leaves are blighted\nComplete defoliation of affected leaves may take place.\nStems and flowers are sometimes attacked\nFruits are rarely attacked\nSurvival and spread:\nPrimary: Mycelium or conidia found in pycnidia in infected plant debris or on solanaceous weeds\nSecondary: Conidia spread through rain splash or wind and also by slimy conidia sticking on to hands and clothing of potato pickers.\nFavourable conditions:\nPoor vigour of plants due to nutrient deficiency in late season\nHigh humidity or persistent dew at 25 ÂºC\nMoist weather with intermittent showers.','Septoria leaf spot','Fungicides','Fungicides are pesticides that kill or prevent the growth of fungi and their spores. They can be used to control fungi that damage plants, including rusts, mildews and blights. They might also be used to control mold and mildew in other settings. Fungicides work in a variety of ways, but most of them damage fungal cell membranes or interfere with energy production within fungal cells.\nA fungal disease in plants can be misdiagnosed easily. Check with your local county extension office for help identifying plant disease. They may also be able to recommend a treatment strategy for your lawn or garden.\nOften, plant diseases are transmitted when leaves are wet. Ground level watering and good air circulation can be used to keep leaves dry.\nMany fungicides remain on the surface of plant tissues and do not spread throughout the plant. Others penetrate the cuticle and circulate through plant tissues.\nPruning shears and other tools can carry plant diseases from one plant to another. Learn about garden sanitation to prevent spreading fungal pathogens yourself.\nAlthough they can slow or stop the development of new symptoms, many fungicides are designed only to prevent disease. These are not highly effective after symptoms have developed.'),(4,'Potato','Disease symptoms:\nThis disease damages leaves, stems, and tubers. Affected leaves appear blistered as if scalded by hot water and eventually rot and dry out.\nWhen drying out, leaves turn brown or black. When infections are still active, spots appear on the underside of leaves blanketed in what looks like flour.\nAffected stems begin to blacken from their tips, and eventually dry out.\nSevere infections cause all foliage to rot, dry out and fall to the ground, stems to dry out, and plants to die.\nAffected tubers display dry brown-colored spots on their skins and flesh. This disease acts very quickly. If it is not controlled, infected plants will die within two or three days.\nSurvival and spread:\nThe pathogen survives in plant debris in the soil.\nIt spreads through the soil and infected seed tubers.\nFavorable condition:\nHigh humidity\nLow temperature and leaf wetness','Late blight','Bravo (chlorothalonil) and Dithane (mancozeb)','If symptoms are observed, treat plants with one of the following fungicides:\n\nApply a copper based fungicide (2 oz/ gallon of water) every 7 days or less, following heavy rain or when the amount of disease is increasing rapidly. If possible, time applications so that at least 12 hours of dry weather follows application.\nUsed as a foliar spray, OrganocideÂ® Plant Doctor will work its way through the entire plant to prevent fungal problems from occurring and attack existing many problems. Mix 2 tsp/ gallon of water and spray at transplant or when direct seeded crops are at 2-4 true leaf, then at 1-2 week intervals as required to control disease.\nSafely treat fungal problems with SERENADE Garden.

All stages of the disease is controlled, but applying before infestation gives the best results.'),(5,'Onion',' Phosphorus deficiency symptoms can appear at all stages but are more pronounced in young plants. Contrary to other nutrients, the symptoms of this deficiency are generally not very striking and can be difficult to identify. In mild cases, a possible indication for this disorder is that plants are dwarfed or stunted. However, no obvious symptoms are observed on leaves. In severe deficiencies, stem and petioles show a dark green to purple discoloration. The lower sides of older leaves also show a purple pigmentation, starting on the tips and margins and later expanding to the rest of the leaf surface. These leaves may become leathery and veins may form a brown netting. In some cases, phosphorus deficiency is characterized by burnt tips and the development of chlorosis as well as necrotic patches on the leaf margins. Flowers and fruits are produced, but fruit yields are low. \n  There are differences in susceptibility to phosphorus deficiency between different crops. Roots absorb phosphate ions when they are dissolved in the soil water. Calcareous soils with high calcium concentrations can be poor in phosphorus. Most commonly, however, it is the availability of this nutrient that is limited because phosphorus is adhered to soil particles and cannot be taken up by the plant. Both alkaline soils and acidic soils can show low availability. Soils with low organic matter or iron-rich soils can also be problematic. Cold weather that hinders proper development and function of the roots can also lead to this disorder. Drought conditions or diseases that limit the absorption of water and nutrients by the roots can trigger deficiency symptoms. Soil moisture, in turn, increases the uptake of this nutrient and results in significantly higher yields. ','Phosporous Deficiency','Diammonium phosphate (DAP), Single super phosphate (SSP)','Phosphorus levels in soils can be replenished by applying farmyard manure, or other materials (organic mulch, compost and guano) or a combination thereof. The incorporation of residues to the soil after harvest can also contribute to maintaining a positive phosphorus balance in the long term and improve soil structure. The decomposition of organic matter provides a steady supply of plant-available phosphorus. Use fertilizers containing phosphorus (P). \nChemical Control:\n- Examples: Diammonium phosphate (DAP), Single super phosphate (SSP).\n- Consult your agricultural advisor to know the best product and dosage for your soil and crop.\n\nFurther recommendations:\n- It is recommended to do a soil test before the start of the cropping season to optimize your crop production.'),(6,'Tomato','Disease appears as spots on leaves, stems and fruits and as wilting of leaves and shoots\nWhite blister like spots in the margins of leaves\nSpots become brown with age and coalesce, but leaves do not fall off\nLeaflets on one side of rachis show withering initially\nLight coloured streaks on stems and petioles at the joints\nCracks develop in streaks and form cankers\nSlimy bacterial ooze through the cracks in humid weather\nSmall, shallow, water soaked, spots with white halo develop on fruits\nThe centers of spots become slightly raised, tan coloured and rough\nVascular discolouration is seen in split open stems','Bacterial stem and fruit canker',' copper fungicides, Organocide Plant Doctor','Treatment:\nPrune flowering trees during blooming when wounds heal fastest.\nRemove wilted or dead limbs well below infected areas.\nAvoid pruning in early spring and fall when bacteria are most active.\nTreat all pruning cuts immediately with TanglefootÂ® Tree Pruning Sealer and make sure to disinfect your pruning equipment â one part bleach to 4 parts water â after each cut.\nIf using string trimmers around the base of trees avoid damaging bark with breathable Tree Wrap to prevent infection.\nBrush bark with white latex paint diluted with water to reduce bark-damaging temperature fluctuations.\nResearch has shown that copper fungicides have some success against this stone fruit problem. However, results are inconsistent. We recommend using it as one part of a total management program.\nRemove weeds and grass from around the base of young trees to improve air circulation and keep the trunk and crown dry.\nOrganocideÂ® Plant Doctor is an earth-friendly systemic fungicide that works its way through the entire plant to combat a large number of diseases on ornamentals, turf, fruit and more. Mix 1/3 to 3/4 oz per gallon of water and paint or spray over pruning wounds and surrounding areas.'),(7,'Tomato','Damage symptoms:\nMoist weather and splattering rains are conducive to disease development. Most outbreaks of the disease can be traced back to heavy rainstorms that occur in the area.\nInfected leaves show small, brown, water soaked, circular spots surrounded with yellowish halo.\nOn older plants the leaflet infection is mostly on older leaves and may cause serious defoliation.\nThe most striking symptoms are on the green fruit. Small, water-soaked spots first appear which later become raised and enlarge until they are one-eighth to one-fourth inch in diameter.\nCenters of these lesions become irregular, light brown and slightly sunken with a rough, scabby surface.\nRipe fruits are not susceptible to the disease. Surface of the seed becomes contaminated with the bacteria, remaining on the seed surface for some time.\nThe organism survives in alternate hosts, on volunteer tomato plants and on infected plant debris.','Bacterial leaf spot','Garden Fungicide, Liquid Copper Spray','Spraying with a baking soda solution (a tablespoon of baking soda, 2 1/2 tablespoons of vegetable oil, a teaspoon of liquid soap, not detergent, to one gallon of water), or neem oil (do not use when pollinating insects including bees or other beneficial insects are present). Baking soda may burn some plant leaves. Spray only a few and then check for a reaction before applying applications every two weeks.\nApply sulfur sprays or copper-based fungicides weekly at first sign of disease to prevent its spread.
