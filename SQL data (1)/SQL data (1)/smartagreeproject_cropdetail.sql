INSERT INTO `cropdetail` VALUES (1,'Onion Allium cepa belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae. Onion is a bulbous plant with the bulbs and leaves are semi-cylindrical or tubular with waxy coating on the surface.Onion in India is cultivated by farmers of almost all states as both Kharif and rabi crop synched with geographical location and weather based.','Onion',' Kharif and rabi','Usually three types of onions are grown commercially in India like White, Yellow and Red.The onion seeds are transplanted in the nursery in about 35 – 40 days. Before transplanting the land should  be ploughed to fine tilth, decomposed farm yard manure 8 tonnes or vermicompost 4 tonnes fortified with biofertilisers 5 kg  and biological agent Multiplex Biojodi 5 kg should be incorporated in the soil.The land can be prepared to flat beds or ridges and furrows based on the seasons. Flat beds with size 1.5 to 2 m width and 4 to 6 m length or broad bed furrows with 15 cm height and 120 cm top width may be prepared. The furrows should be 45 cm deep so that proper drainage is ensured.The onion seedlings nursery of 0.12 acre land is required to raise for one acre of onion crop. Prepare nursery beds of size 7.5 m length, l.2 m width and 10cm height. Add 3 - 4 basketful of FYM/compost, 200g BACILLUS + PSEUDOMONAS (Multiplex Biojodi) and Bio activator mixtures (Ecohume Gr granules) per bed.\n\nMix all the above products well & incorporate into the soil. Sow the seeds in the rows of 7.5 cm apart to facilitate the easy weding and uprooting during transplanting. Seeds after sowing need to be covered with soil or farm yard manure and irrigate the beds immediately. Again after 10 days add 0.5 kg/bed 15:15:15 (N:P:K). Seedlings will be ready for transplanting within 6- 8 weeks after sowing. Then transplant the seedling at 15 cm x 7.5 cm spacing.','Onion plants are transplanted to main filed at the age of 35 - 40 days. During transplantation proper care is taken and should avoid over aged seedlings.\n\nSome of the important factors need to followed during transplanting.\n\nAbout one-third of the top of the seedling is cut\nRoots are dipped in 2 gm Metalaxyl 35% [Krilaxyl Power]solution for two hours to prevent fungal diseases\nThe seedlings are transplanted into prepared beds at a distance of 10 – 15 cm between plants.irect seeds sowing: After thorough land preparation directly sow the seeds in a row of 30 cm apart and 30 cm between plants.\n\nBroadcasting: Broadcast the seeds after land preparation and Basal applications. Thinning may be required at highly populated dense growth of the onion saplings.','Onion crop requires water or moisture to survive and grow. Irrigation for onion crop starts from immediately of seedling plantation or sowing and 3 days after planting or sowing. Subsequently the irrigation in regular intervals need to be provided to supply proper moisture for growth and development of onions. Over watering, less watering supplying irregular with dry spells will harm onion growth and development. Supply of irrigation abruptly to onion crop, the bulbs may develop splitting and reduce the crop quality. The last irrigation to the onion crop must be stopped 10 days before harvest.Recent techniques of irrigation like sprinkler, drip may be adopted to supply proper watering to the onion crop as they will help maintaining required ideal moisture level in soil.','Recommended dose of Fertilizer Application: NPK – 50:30:40 kg/ per acre per crop\n\n6 to 8 ton of FYM applied at the time of soil preparation per acre along with 20 kg N, 20 kg P2O5 & 20 kg Potash /acre should be applied along micro nutrient 5 kg Zinc high Aries Multi Micronutrient fertiliser + 15 kg Calcium nitrate.Remaining 20 kg N + 10 kg P and 20 kg Potash to be applied after a month of sowing and another 10 kg of N 20- 25 days before harvest.','Almost all soils such as heavy soil, clayey soil, sandy loam, etc are suitable for onion growing. Red to black loamy soil with good drainage is best suited and ideal. Soil must be friable with lots of organic matter and good water holding capacity.So, adding organic matter during preparation of land in the form of compost or farm yard manure or well decomposed poultry manure is more important. Soils with pH range of 6.0 to 7.0 is more ideal and onions cannot survive beyond the range.'),(2,'Potato (Solanum tuberosum) is the most important food crop of the world. Potato is a temperate crop grown under subtropical conditions in India. The potato is a crop which has always been the ‘poor man’s friend’. Potato is being cultivated in the country for the last more than 300 years. For vegetable purposes it has become one of the most popular crops in this country. Potatoes are an economical food; they provide a source of low cost energy to the human diet. Potatoes are a rich source of starch, vitamins especially C and B1 and minerals. They contain 20.6 per cent carbohydrates, 2.1 per cent protein, 0.3 per cent fat, 1.1 per cent crude fibre and 0.9 per cent ash. They also contain a good amount of essential amino acids like leucine, tryptophane and isoleucine etc. Potato is grown in India under diverse agroclimatic conditions.  The varieties should make the best use of the agroclimatic conditions and give high yield.  Broadly the potato growing zones in India could be classified into the northern hills, the northern plains, the eastern hills, the plateau region and the southern hills.  The growing season in the northern hills is the kharif season with long days.  The crop experiences water stress during the emergence and initial growth phase while during the maximum bulking phase it is invariably exposed to late blight infection.  Therefore varieties for this region requires resistance to late blight, should be able to withstand water stress, be able to yield well under long day conditions and the crop duration can be between 120 – 150 days.  Presently Kufri Jyoti and Kufri Giriraj are the main varieties for this region.','Potato','Summer and Kharif crops','Potato is propagated by tubers. Tubers are thick underground stems also called stolon.\nSowing time and Seed Selection\nPotatoes are grown in the Rabi season between October and November, when the highest and minimum temperatures are 30 Degree Celsius and 20 degrees Celsius, respectively. The seeds/tubers used should be medium in size (20-125 g weight) and bought from a reputable source.\nSeed Treatment\nPotato seed/tuber must be kept in a cool, shady place for one to two weeks after being removed from cold storage to allow sprouts to emerge. Tubers can be treated with Gibberellic acid 1g/lit of water and then dried in a shady place before being kept in an aerated chamber for 10 days to achieve uniform sprouts. To prevent tuber rotting, soak tubers in a 0.5 percent Mancozeb solution for 10 minutes.\n\nSpacing between the tubers\n\nThe planting distance preferred for potato crop should be 50*20 cm and 60*25 cm. And seed rate of 1.40 kg for 10 meter square of area.','Manure and Fertilizer Requirement:\nApply 250-400 g/ha Farm Yard Manure and for fulfilling nutrients requirement, 120-160 kg/ha Nitrogen, 80-120 kg/ha Phosphorus and 80-120 kg/ha Potassium. All these should be applied to the soil 2-3 weeks before plantation. At the time of sowing, apply 3/4th dose of Nitrogen, and a full dose of Phosphorus and Potassium fertilizer. Remaining, 1/4th dose of Nitrogen fertilizer at the time of earthing up operation, after 30-40 days of sowing.\n\nEarthing up operation is performed for proper aeration, temperature, and moisture maintenance in the soil. In this, the soil is drawn up around the base of the plant for proper tuber formation; it is done when the plant attains a height of 15-20 cm. The second earthing operation can be performed two weeks after the first one if required.','Irrigation Requirement:\nPotato crops require frequent irrigation, depending on soil moisture. Pre-sowing irrigation, irrigation after 3-4 days of sowing, and rest mild irrigations total 5-6 irrigations. Irrigation must be turned off 10-12 days prior to harvesting.Irrigation has a special significance in the potato production as the plant has shallow and sparse root system. First irrigation should be light and given 5-7 days after planting and subsequent irrigation are given at 7-15 days interval depending upon the climatic condition and soil type. The drip system of irrigation is most economical giving highest productivity and saving almost 50% water. It also enables application of fertilizers through irrigation water. The sprinkler system gives uniform distribution of water and reduces water losses by percolation and run off. Sprinkler irrigation is beneficial on frosty nights as it reduces frost damage in potatoes. It is recommended for areas with undulating topography, extremely sandy soil and scarce water supply. Under such situations, the use of sprinkler systems increases water use efficiency by 40% as compared to furrow irrigation.','How to Protect the Plant?\nPotato crops can be attacked by various pests and diseases, so proper measures should be taken and pesticides should be incorporated.\nPests\nAphid- They cause curling and deformation of young leaves. Cut the foliage according region timing. And spray Actara 25WG600g/ha.\nLeaf eating caterpillars- They feed on potato leaves and damage them. Spray Profenofos @ 2ml.\nCut Worms- They cut sprout at ground level and damages the crop. Spray Tracer 48 SC 200 ml/ha.\nPotato tuber moth- This is the most common pest in both the field and the storage. To protect the crop from this, use only healthy seeds and well-decomposed cow manure. It is a very effective approach to cover the soil with a 2-inch layer of sand.\nWhite grub- They cause crop damage by feeding on the root, stem, and tuber. Collect larvae while tilling soil, planting, and weeding to manage this pest. Also, deploy bird predators to minimize the population of white grubs.','The potato can be grown almost on any type of soil except saline and alkaline soils. Soils, which are naturally loose, offer least resistance to the enlargement of the tubers is preferred. Loamy and sandy loam soils, rich in organic matter with good drainage and aeration are most suitable for cultivation of potato crop. The soil with pH range of 5.2-6.4 is considered to be ideal.\nPotato is a temperate climate crop, however it grows under a diverse range of climatic conditions. It is grown only under such conditions where the temperature during the growing seasons is moderately cool. The vegetative growth of the plant is best at a temperature of 24°C while tuber development is favoured at 20°C. Hence, potato is grown as a summer crop in the hills and as a winter crop in the tropical and subtropical regions. The crop can be raised up to an altitude of 3000 m above the sea level.'),(3,'Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) is an annual or short lived perennial pubescent herb and greyish green curled uneven pinnate leaves. The flowers are off white bearing fruits which are red or yellow in colour. It is a self pollinated crop.\n\nThe major tomato producing states are Maharashtra, Bihar, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Assam.','Tomato','Globe, Beefsteak, Cherry, Plum, and Oxheart','Nursery Bed Preparation\n\nTomato seeds are sown on nursery beds to raise seedlings for transplanting in the field. Raised beds of size 3 x 0.6 m and 10-15 cm in height are prepared. About 70 cm distance is kept between two beds to carry out operations of watering, weeding, etc. The surface of beds should be smooth and well levelled. Add sieved FYM and fine sand on the seedbed. Raised beds are necessary to avoid problem of water logging in heavy soils. In sandy soils, however, sowing can be taken up in flat beds. To avoid mortality of seedlings due to damping off, drench the seed bed first with water and then with Bavistin (15-20 g/10 litres of water).\n\nSeason of Planting\n\nSeeds are sown in June July for autumn winter crop and for spring summer crop seeds are sown in November. In the hills seed is sown in March April.\n\nRaising of Seedlings\n\nAbout 250-300 g of seed are sufficient for raising seedlings for one hectare of land. Prior to sowing seeds are treated with fungal culture of Trichoderma viride (4 g/ kg of seed) or Thiram (2g/kg of seed) to avoid damage from damping-off disease. Sowing should be done thinly in lines spaced at 10-15 cm distance. Seeds are sown at a depth of 2-3 cm and covered with a fine layer of soil followed by light watering by water can. The beds should then be covered with dry straw or grass or sugarcane leaves to maintain required temperature and moisture. The watering should be done by water can as per the need till germination is completed. The cover of dry straw or grass is removed immediately after germination is complete. During the last week in nursery, the seedlings may be hardened by slightly withholding water.\n\nThe seedlings with 5-6 true leaves are ready for transplanting within 4 of sowing.','Land Preparation\n\nThe field is ploughed to fine tilth by giving four to five ploughing with a sufficient interval between two ploughing. Planking should be done for proper levelling. Furrows are then opened at the recommended spacing. Well-decomposed FYM (25 t/ha) is thoroughly incorporated at the time of land preparation.\n\nSpacing\n\nSpacing depends upon the type of variety grown and the season of planting. Normally the seedlings are transplanted at a spacing of 75-90 x 45-60 cm.\n\nMethod of Planting\n\nSeedlings are transplanted in furrows in light soils and on side of the ridges in case of heavy soils. A pre-soaking irrigation is given 3-4 days prior to transplanting. Before planting seedlings should be dipped in a solution prepared by Nuvacron (15ml) and Dithane M - 45 (25g) in 10 litres of water for 5-6 minutes. Transplanting should preferably be done in the evening.','Weed Control\n\nThe field should be kept weed-free, especially in the initial stage of plant growth, as weeds compete with the crop and reduce the yield drastically. Frequent shallow cultivation should be done at regular interval so as to keep the field free from weeds and to facilitate soil aeration and proper root development. Deep cultivation is injurious because of the damage of roots and exposure of moist soil to the surface. Two-three hoeing and the earthing up are required to keep the crop free of weeds. Pre- emergence application of Basalin (1kg a.i./ha) or Pendimethalin (1kg a.i./ha), coupled with one hand weeding 45 days after transplanting is effective for control of weeds. Plastic mulching (black or transparent) can be used to control the weeds. Weeds can be controlled successfully by mulching plus use of herbicides such as Pendimethalin (0.75 kg a.i./ha) or Oxyfluorfen (0.12 kg a.i./ha).\n\nCrop Rotation\n\nTomato should not be grown successively on the same field and a break of at least one year is required between planting of tomatoes or other Solanacesous crops (eg. Chillies, Brinjals, Capsicum, Potato, Tobacco, etc.), cucurbits and many other vegetables. The crops, which can be grown after tomatoes, are as follows- Cereals (eg. Rice, Corn Sorghum, Wheat, Millets, etc.) or Cruciferons crops (eg. Cabbage, Cauliflower, Kohlrabi etc) or Radish, Watermelon, Onion, Garlic, Groundnut, Cotton, Safflower , Sunflower, Sesame, Sugar beet and Marigold.\n\nIntercropping\n\nTomato is well fitted in different cropping systems of cereals, grains, pulses and oilseeds. Cropping systems rice-tomato, rice-maize, okra-potato-tomato, tomato-onion are popular in various parts of India. Spinach or radish can also be grown as inter-crop in tomato successfully.\n\nStaking\n\nDue to the tall habit and heaving bearing nature of the hybrids staking is essential. Staking facilitates intercultural operations and helps in maintaining the quality of the fruits. It is done 2-3 weeks after transplanting. Staking can be done either by wooden stakes or laying overhead wires to which individual plant is tied. In case of indeterminate types, tow or three wires are stretched parallel to each other along the row and plants are tied to these wires.','Irrigation:\nTomato is very sensitive to water application. Heavy irrigation provided after a long spell of drought causes cracking of the fruits. Hence it should be avoided. Light irrigation should be given 3-4 days after transplanting. Irrigation intervals should be according to soil type and rainfall, irrigation should be given 7-8 days interval during kharif, during rabi 10-12 days and 5-6 days during summer.\nFlowering and fruit development are the critical stages of tomato therefore; water stress should not be given during this period.\n\nManuring & Fertilization:\nThe fertilizer dose depends upon the fertility of soil and amount of organic manure applied to the crop. For a good yield, 15-20 tonnes of well-decomposed FYM is incorporated into the soil. Generally, application of 120 kg N, 80 kg P2O5 and 50 kg K2O per hectare is recommended for getting optimum yield. Half dose of N and full dose of P and K is given at the time of planting. The balance half of N is given as top dressing 30 days after transplanting.\n\nFor hybrid varieties, the recommended dose per hectare is 180 kg N, 100 kg P2 O5 and 60 kg K2 O. 60 kg N and half of P & K are given at the time of transplanting. Remaining quantities of P & K and 60 kg N is top dressed 30 after transplanting. A third dose of 60 kg N is applied 50 days after transplanting.','Soil:\nTomato can be grown on a wide range of soils from sandy to heavy clay. However, well-drained, sandy or red loam soils rich in organic matter with a pH range of 6.0-7.0 are considered as ideal.\n\nClimate:\nTomato is a warm season crop. The best fruit colour and quality is obtained at a temperature range of 21-24°C. Temperatures above 32o C adversely affects the fruit set and development. The plants cannot withstand frost and high humidity. It requires a low to medium rainfall. Bright sunshine at the time of fruit set helps to develop dark red coloured fruits. Temperature below 10 oC adversely affects plant tissues thereby slowing down physiological activities.'),(4,'Brinjal is one of the most common tropical vegetables grown in India. It is known by different names like Begun (Bengali), ringna (Gujarathi), baingan ( Hindi), badane (Kannada), waangum (Kashmiri), vange ( Marathi), baigan (Oriya), Vashuthana ( Malayalam), Kathiri (Tamil), venkaya (Telugu) and Peethabhala (Sanskrit). A large number of cultivars differing in size, shape and colour of fruits are grown in India. Immature fruits are used in curries and a variety of dishes are prepared out of brinjal. Fruits are moderate sources of vitamins and minerals like phosphorous, calcium and iron and nutritive value varies from variety to variety.','Brinjal','Pusa Purple Long,Pusa Purple Cluster,Pusa Kranti,Pusa Barsati,Manjri Gota.','Brinjal seeds are sown on nursery beds to raise seedlings for transplanting in the field. Raised beds are necessary to avoid problem of water logging in heavy soils. In sandy soils, however, sowing can be taken up in flat beds. Raised beds of size 7.2 x 1.2 m and 10-15 cm in height are prepared. Thus, ten such beds are sufficient to raise seedlings for planting one hectare area. About 70cm distance is kept between two beds to carry out operations of watering, weeding, etc. The surface of beds should be smooth and well levelled. Well-decomposed FYM or leaf mould may be mixed with the soil at the time of bed preparation. To avoid mortality of seedlings due to damping off, drenching of the beds with Bavistin (15-20 g/10 litres of water) is effective.\n\nSowing should be done thinly in lines spaced at 5-7 cm distance. Seeds are sown at a depth of 2-3 cm and covered with a fine layer of soil followed by light watering by water can. The beds should then be covered with dry straw or grass or sugarcane leaves to maintain required temperature and moisture. The watering should be done by water can as per the need till germination is completed. The cover of dry straw or grass is removed immediately after germination is complete. During the last week in nursery, the seedlings may be hardened by slightly withholding water. The seedlings are ready for transplanting within 4-6 weeks of planting when they attain a height of 15 cm with 2-3 true leaves.','The fertilizer dose depends upon the fertility of soil and amount of organic manure applied to the crop. For a good yield, 15-20 tonnes of well-decomposed FYM is incorporated into the soil.\n\nGenerally, application of 150 kg N, 100 kg P2O5 and 50 kg K2O is recommended for optimum yield. Half dose of N 25 2 and full dose of P and K is given at the time of planting. The balance half of N is given in 3 equal split doses. The first split dose is given one and half month after transplanting, the second dose one month after the first application and the final at three and half months after transplanting.\n\nFor hybrid varieties, the recommended dose is 200 kg N, 100 kg P2O5 and 100 Kg K2O. Out of this dose, 25 2 25 % of N and 100 % of P & K is applied as basal dose. Remaining 75 % of P is applied in three equal split doses. The first split dose of N is applies 20 days after transplanting. The second dose is given just before the onset of flowering while the third after the first picking/harvesting.','The field should be kept weed-free, especially in the initial stage of plant growth, as weeds compete with the crop and reduce the yield drastically. Frequent shallow cultivation should be done at regular interval so as to keep the field free from weeds and to facilitate soil aeration and proper root development. Deep cultivation is injurious because of the damage of roots and exposure of moist soil to the surface. Two-three hoeing and the earthing up are required to keep the crop free of weeds. Pre- emergence application of Fluchloralin (1.5 kg a.i./ha) coupled with one hand weeding 30 days after transplanting is effective for control of weeds.','The fruits become ready for first picking in about 120-130 days of seed sowing depending on the variety. The harvesting of the fruits should be done as soon as it attains a good size and colour. Fruits are harvested when they become greenish yellow or bronze and their flesh turns dry and tough. Pressing the thumb against the side of the fruit can indicate the maturity of the fruit. If the pressed portion springs back to its original shape, the fruit is too immature. Some portion of the calyx and the stem-end is retained on the fruit during harvesting. Since all the fruits do not mature at the same time, the fruits are harvested at an interval of 8-10 days.','Land Preparation\n\nThe field is ploughed to fine tilth by giving four to five ploughing with a sufficient interval between two ploughing. Planking should be done for proper levelling. The field is then divided into beds and channels. Well-decomposed FYM is thoroughly incorporated at the time of land preparation.\n\nSpacing\n\nSpacing depends upon the type of variety grown and the season of planting. Normally the long fruited varieties are transplanted at 60 x 45 cm, the round varieties at 75 x 60 cm and high yielding varieties at 90 x 90 cm spacing. Seedlings are transplanted in furrows in light soils and on side of the ridges in case of heavy soils. A pre-soaking irrigation is given 3-4 days prior to transplanting. At the time of transplanting, the roots of the seedlings should be dipped in a solution of Bavistin (2g/litre of water). Transplanting should preferably be done in the evening.'),(5,'General Information. It is known as the most valuable crop of India.

In vine cutting method (commonly used), the tubers are taken from the old vines and planted on prepared nursery beds.  Mainly vines are planted in ridges or on prepared flat beds. It is seen that terminal cuttings gives better result. The host plant must have at least 4 nodes. Row spacing of 60cm and within row spacing of 30cm is used. Before planting it is better to treat the cuttings with DDT 50% solution for 8-10 minutes.',' Apply FYM (Farm Yard Manure) @100 qtl/acre. Along with FYM apply fertilizer dose in terms of CAN @125 kg/acre, SSP @155 kg/acre and MOP @35 kg/acre.\n\nFull dose of K2O and P2O5 is applied at the time of planting. Nitrogen dose is applied in 2 splits i.e. first at the time of planting and secondly should be applied after 5 weeks of planting.After planting, irrigation is given once in 2 days for period of 10 days and thereafter irrigation is given once in 7-10 days. Irrigation must be stopped before 3 weeks of harvesting. But before 2 days of harvesting one irrigation is necessary.','Apply Metribuzine 70WP@200gm per acre or Alachlor@2Ltr per acre before sprouts emergence. On 5-10% sprout emergence and ridge are infested with weeds then only apply Paraquat@500-750ml per acre.','It is grown in variety of soil types ranging from sandy to loamy soil, but it gives best result when grown under sandy loam soil having high fertility and good drainage system.

Apply whole amount of SSP and MOP and one third of Urea at time of sowing. Apply remaining dose of nitrogen at knee height stage and pre tasseling stage.\n\nZinc and magnesium deficiency are common in maize crop. To overcome this deficiency, apply Znso4@8kg/acre as basal dose. Along with zinc and magnesium deficiency, iron deficiency is also observed. Due to this whole plant gives yellow appearance. To overcome this deficiency, apply micro-nutrients mixture@25/acre mixed with 25 kg of sand after sowing the maize seed.','Weeds are the serious problem in maize, particularly during kharif/monsoon season they competes with maize for nutrient and causes yield loss upto 35%. Therefore, timely weed management is needed for achieving higher yield. Take atleast one or two hand weeding in maize crop. First 20-25 days after sowing and second when on 40-45 days after sowing. If weed infestation is high, spray with Atrazine @500gm per 200 Ltr of water. After weeding, apply fertilizer as top dressing and carry out earthing up operation.','It is grown in variety of soil types ranging from sandy to loamy soil, but it gives best result when grown under sandy loam soil having high fertility and good drainage system. Avoid cultivation of sweet potato in very light sandy and heavy clayey soil as it is not good for tuber development. It requires pH ranging from 5.8-6.7 is best for sweet potato cultivation.'),(8,'Wheat is grown on 13 percent of the cropped area of India. Next to rice, wheat is the most important food-grain of India and is the staple food of millions of Indians, particularly in the northern and north-western parts of the country.                                                                                                                    \nIt is rich in proteins, vitamins and carbohydrates and provides balanced food.

Delayed sowing causes a gradual decline in the yield of wheat. The time of sowing is 25 October – November.\n\nSPACING\nFor normal sown crop a spacing of 20 - 22.5 cm between rows is recommended. When sowing is delayed a closer spacing of 15-18 cm should be adopted.\n\nSOWING DEPTH\nThe sowing depth should be 4-5 cm.\n\nMETHOD OF SOWING\n1. Seed drill\n2. Broadcasting method\n3. Zero tillage drill\n4. Rotavator','CHEMICAL WEED CONTROL: Preferred because of less labour requirement and no mechanical damage during manual weeding. As pre-emergence, apply Pendimethalin (Stomp 30 EC) @1 Ltr at 0-3 days before sowing in 200 litres of water/acre. Use 2, 4-D @250 ml in 150 ltr water for controlling broad leaf weeds.','The number of irrigations required will vary depending upon soil type, water availability etc. Crown root initiation and heading stages are the most critical to moisture stress. For dwarf high yielding varieties, give pre sowing irrigation. For heavy soils, four to six irrigations are required whereas for light soils 6-8 irrigations are necessary. Under limited water supply apply irrigation only at critical stage. When water is available for only one irrigation, then apply at crown root initiation stage. When two irrigations are available then apply at crown root initiation and flowering stage. Where three irrigations are possible, 1st irrigation should be given at CRI stage and 2nd at late jointing (boot) and 3rd at milking stage. CRI stage is most important stage for irrigation. It has been found that each week delay in 1st irrigation from CRI stage results in yield reduction of 83-125kg per acre.\n\nFirst irrigation should be given 20-25 days after sowing. This is crown root initiation stage and moisture stress at this stage will lead to yield loss. At tillering stage within 40-45 days after sowing, apply second irrigation. Third irrigation within 60-65 DAS at late jointing stage. At flowering stage (within 80-85 days) give fourth irrigation. Fifth irrigation at dough stage (within 100-105 DAS).','Harvesting of high yielding dwarf variety is carried out when leaves and stem turn yellow and become fairly dry. To avoid loss in yield crop should be harvested before it is dead ripe. Timely harvesting is needed for optimum quality and consumer acceptance. The right stage for harvesting is when moisture in grain reaches to 25-30%. For manual harvesting use serrate edge sickles. Combines harvester are also available which can do harvesting, threshing and winnowing of wheat crop in single operation.','After harvest of previous crop, the field should be ploughed with disc or mould board plough. Field is usually prepared by giving one deep plough with iron plough followed by two or three times local plough and planking. Carried out plough in evening time and kept furrow open whole night to absorb some moisture from dew. Planking should be done after each plough early in the morning.'),(9,'Bajra or pearl millet is widely grown millet in the world. It can tolerate drought, thats why it is well adopted in region of scanty rainfall. India is largest producer of Bajra. Along with human consumption, it is used for fodder purpose, its stalk are used to feed animals. Major Pearl millet growing areas in India are Punjab, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Gujarat, UP, Haryana, MP, Karnataka, AP and Tamil Nadu.  \n\nIn 2002-03 in Punjab approximately 0.8 thousand hectare land is used for Bajra cultivation and gave an average yield of 3.9qtl/acre.
